# Exam Day
You have one exam remaining before you can enjoy your sweet summer freedom. Go through the life of the protagonist on their exam day in this basic visual novel to learn Godot and Dialogic.

You can download the most recent version of the game by going to [Releases](https://github.com/michlam/exam-day/releases).


## Planned Features
There are a few features that I hope to implement:
- Main menu
- Saving and loading
- Dialogue management
- Branching storylines
- In-game HUD for story purposes
- Music
- Sound effects
- Settings
